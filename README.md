> Left - Right

The keymap is based on the standard qwerty layout, which I am used to. The layout is edited with: <https://get.vial.today/>.

### Layer-0

By default the layer-0 is the alphabet keys (a-z), and two columns (tab/capslock/shift on the left, enter/shift on the righr) around the alphas. The thumb keys are also the same with standard qwerty keyboard, i.e. alt (or command key on mac) and space.

But there are 2 special keys been set to [MO and TO](https://get.vial.today/manual/layers.html#moving-between-layers), we will discuss this later.

### Layer-1

Layer-1 is the extention of the alphas, mostly for those symbols such as `,.()+-@*?!`, numbers (1-9).

They also follow a similar layout with standard qwerty keyboard, so I won't feel confused when switch to layer-1.
